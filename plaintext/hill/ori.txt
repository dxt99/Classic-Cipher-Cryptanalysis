Hello Captain Haddock,
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won the hearts of Muslims across the globe when she,
wearing a headscarf, comforted the families of victims of the massacre in two mosques by a 
white supremacist in Christchurch in 2019. Last Thursday, she again astonished an even larger
audience with her abrupt resignation, although she stands a great chance to win the upcoming election in October.
The mother of four-year-old Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford has undoubtedly made a name for herself as an icon of
statesmanship. She has played a role model of a leader who not only does her best for her nation, but also
knows when to fade away to ensure a sustainable succession. She could have sought a third term,
but she shows she is not hungry for power.
